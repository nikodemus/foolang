# Foolang

!> This is a toy language implemented by a single person&mdash;use for quiet enjoyment only.

**_The Foo Programming Language_**

Foolang is a Smalltalk-inspired language that, like all new languages,
has what you might generously call _somewhat optimistic aspirations_:

- Elegance and power of Smalltalk
- Performance of C++
- Fault tolerance of Erlang

**_"Are we there yet?"_**

Nope.

**_"When we going to get there?"_**

Someday!

## Hello World

``` foolang
class Main {}
    direct method run: command in: system
        system output println: "Hello world"!
end
```

## Getting Started

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Clone the Foolang repository:
   ``` shell
   git clone https://github.com/nikodemus/foolang.git
   ```
3. Build Foolang & run the REPL:
   ``` shell
   cd foolang
   cargo run -- foo/repl.foo
   ```
4. Read the [syntax](syntax.md#foolang-syntax) document, read the code, play around.

## Features & Status

### Done

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Lexically scoped object language**: everything is an object. Names are
scoped lexically. Smalltalk-style blocks are lexical closures.

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Ergonomic syntax**: while Foolang syntax is not _quite_ as minimal as
Smalltalk's it is very simple and ergonomic.

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**No ambient authority**: all OS interfaces must be passed through dependency
injection, starting from the [system object](system.md) passed to
`Main##run:in:`&mdash;there is no such thing as a globally accessible `File` or
`Socket` class. (Note: the system object doesn't contain nearly all facilities
it should yet!)

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Reified types**: Types like _Integer_ are runtime objects capable of
responding to messages.

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Optional typing & typechecks**: all expressions can
be annotated with types, including method parameters and return values.
Currently these types are checked at runtime. 

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Multiple inheritance of interfaces**: classes can inherit from multiple
interfaces, which can both provide default implementations for methods, and
require other methods to be implemented by the class. Interfaces can also
inherit from other interfaces. Foolang interfaces are fairly similar to traits,
but do not yet support explicit conflict resolution. (See
[Sch√§rli2003](bibliography.md#scharli2003).)

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**No inheritance of implementations**: similarly to Julia and Rust, concrete
instantiable classes cannot be inherited from in Foolang.

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Non-local returns**: Foolang supports Smalltalk-style non-local returns
from closures, allowing simple implementations for powerful control structures.
 
<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Dynamic bindings**: dynamic bindings combined with lexical closures
allow powerful error handling to be implemented in user code,
implementation of interesting paradigms like context oriented programming,
and make dependency injection easier.

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Condition system**: Foolang' exception/error handling is inspired by
Common Lisp's acclaimed condition system: errors can be handled without
unwinding the stack when appropriate.

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Interactive development**: Foolang supports
a dynamic and interactive way of working: in development mode existing methods
can be redefined and new classes added while the program is running.

### Pending

<span class="todo">&cross;</span>
**Self-Hosted**: self-hosted parser and interpreter are almost complete,
work on self-hosted transpiler to C for bootstrap is about to start.

<span class="todo">&cross;</span> **Compiled**: Foolang is intended to be
capable of producing native, monolithic executables&mdash;without compromising
the interactive development experience.

<span class="todo">&cross;</span>
**Extensible syntax & code generation**: Foolang is intended to offer a
compile-time computation facility similar to Lisp's macros, allowing both
syntactic convenience and ability to generate code.

<span class="todo">&cross;</span>
**Type inference**: while Foolang's typesystem should be considered
weaksouce by today's standards doing basic type inference is critical for
the intendend functionality.

<span class="todo">&cross;</span>
**Performant**: type-annotated and compiled Foolang code should perform about as well
as equivalent `-O0` C++ code. To be fair: this will require more effort from
the compiler than C++, but not drastically so&mdash;a partial evaluation pass
should cover most of it.

<span class="todo">&cross;</span>
**Supervised and isolated threads**: Foolang threads will not share memory,
hopefully providing a subtrate for fault tolerant computing akin to what Erlang
does. (Unlike Erlang Foolang does allow thread-local side-effects.)

<span class="todo">&cross;</span>
**Smalltalkish development environment**: while Foolang keeps it's code in files
and allows you to use your favorite editor, it still wants to provide an
integrated experience similar to Smalltalks.
