# Foolang

!> This is a toy language implemented by a single person&mdash;use for quiet enjoyment only.

**_The Foo Programming Language_**

Foolang is a Smalltalk-inspired language that, like all new languages, has
somewhat _optimistic aspirations_:

- **_Elegance and power of Smalltalk and Self:_** Smalltalk/Objective-C -like
  syntax, deep object orientation, late binding, interactive development.

- **_Performance of C++:_** AOT compilation to native code, support for early
  binding so that the compiler can do its thing, low-level datatypes and
  operations when you need them for performance.

- **_Fault tolerance of Erlang:_** Actor-model, isolated heaps, and supervisors.
  No undefined behaviour. No deadlocks, or memory errors or races.

- **_Multiplatform Citizen of the Web:_** WASM is a supported target in addition
  to Windows, MacOS, Linux, and BSDs.

**_"Are we there yet?"_**

:rofl:

Syntax is still going to change, WASM isn't supported, BSDs might work but
aren't tested, early binding support isn't quite there, compiler is a
work-in-progress trivial transpiler, actors and continuations haven't even been
started, there is no interactive development environment to speak of, etc.

**_"When we going to get there?"_**

Someday, I hope!

## Hello World

``` foolang
class Main {}
    direct method run: command in: system
        system output println: "Hello world"!
end
```

## Getting Started

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Clone the Foolang repository:
   ``` shell
   git clone https://github.com/nikodemus/foolang.git
   ```
3. Build Foolang bootstrap interpreter & run the REPL:
   ``` shell
   cd foolang
   cargo run -- foo/repl.foo
   ```
3. Bootstrap the Foolang compiler (you'll need Clang installed for this):
   ``` shell
   ./bootstrap.sh
   build/foo --compile foo/examples/hello.foo
   foo/example/hello
   ```
4. Read the [syntax](syntax.md#foolang-syntax) document, read the code (particularly under `foo/`), and play around.

## Features & Status

### Done

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Lexically scoped object language**: everything is an object. Names are
scoped lexically. Smalltalk-style blocks are lexical closures.

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Ergonomic syntax**: while Foolang syntax is not _quite_ as minimal as
Smalltalk's it is very simple and ergonomic.

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**No ambient authority**: all OS interfaces must be passed explicitly, starting
from the [system object](system.md) passed to `Main##run:in:`&mdash;without it
there is no way to open a file or a socket, check the clock, or run an external
program. (Note: the system object doesn't contain nearly all facilities it
should yet!)

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Reified types**: Types like _Integer_ are runtime objects capable of
responding to messages.

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Optional typing & typechecks**: all expressions can
be annotated with types, including method parameters and return values.
Currently these types are checked at runtime.

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Multiple inheritance of interfaces**: classes can inherit from multiple
interfaces, which can both provide default implementations for methods, and
require other methods to be implemented by the class. Interfaces can also
inherit from other interfaces. Foolang interfaces are fairly similar to traits,
but do not yet support explicit conflict resolution. (See
[Sch√§rli2003](bibliography.md#scharli2003).)

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**No inheritance of implementations**: similarly to Julia and Rust, concrete
instantiable classes cannot be inherited from in Foolang.

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Non-local returns**: Foolang supports Smalltalk-style non-local returns
from closures, allowing simple implementations for powerful control structures.

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Dynamic bindings**: dynamic bindings combined with lexical closures
allow powerful error handling to be implemented in user code,
implementation of interesting paradigms like context oriented programming,
and make dependency injection easier.

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Condition system**: Foolang' exception/error handling is inspired by
Common Lisp's acclaimed condition system: errors can be handled without
unwinding the stack when appropriate.

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Interactive development**: Foolang supports
a dynamic and interactive way of working: in development mode existing methods
can be redefined and new classes added while the program is running. ...kind of.
The bootstrap interpreter REPL qualifies, but the self-hosted environment
isn't interactive yet.

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Self-Hosted**: Foolang is implemented in Foolang: it has a self-hosted parser,
interpreter, and a transpiler-to-C, making it capable of building itself.
(Bootstrap is currently through an interpreter written in Rust.)

<span class="done">&check;</span>
**Compiled**: Foolang is intended to be capable of producing native, monolithic
executables for delivery.

### Pending

<span class="todo">&cross;</span>
**Performant**: type-annotated and compiled Foolang code should perform about as
well as equivalent `-O0` C++ code. To be fair: this will require more effort
from the compiler than C++, but not drastically so&mdash;a partial evaluation
pass should cover most of it. Current compiler is *definititely* not there yet:
it's barely faster than the bootstrap evaluator at the moment!

<span class="todo">&cross;</span>
**Type inference**: while Foolang's typesystem should be considered
weaksauce by today's standards, doing basic type inference is critical for
the intendend functionality.

<span class="todo">&cross;</span>
**Actor model**: Foolang is intended to have lightweight threads implementing an
actor model without shared memory, using an N:M mapping to native threads. This
is intended to provide a substrate for fault tolerant computing akin to what
Erlang does. (Unlike Erlang Foolang does allow thread-local side-effects.)

<span class="todo">&cross;</span>
**Smalltalkish development environment**: while Foolang keeps it's code in files
and allows you to use your favorite editor, it still wants to provide an
integrated experience similar to Smalltalk's.

<span class="todo">&cross;</span>
**Delimited continuations**: plan is to implement shift/reset style of continuations
at the core, and provide nice abtractions like coroutines and non-deterministic
choise operators on top of them.

<span class="todo">&cross;</span>
**Extensible syntax & code generation**: Foolang is intended to offer a
compile-time computation facility similar to Lisp's macros, allowing both
syntactic convenience and ability to generate code.
