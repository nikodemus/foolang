# Foolang Code of Conduct

Foolang is currently a one person project. I have strong views about what it is
about, and where it should go.

However: _anyone_ is welcome to join, regardless of you age, body size,
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

I pledge to make you participation in the project a harassment-free experience,
by:
- being kind and emphathetic.
- being respectful of your differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- accepting responsibility for my mistakes, apologizing to those
  affected, and learning from experience.

So, welcome.

Signed,

   Nikodemus Siivola
