# Foolang Code of Conduct

**Why does a one person project need a code of conduct?!**

1. Because hopefully Foolang won't remain a one person project forever.
2. Because having a code of conduct should not be a special thing.

**Foolang Code of Conduct**

Foolang pledges to making participation in the project a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity,
sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

So, welcome.
