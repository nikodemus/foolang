your alley don't hesitate to get involved.

Check out [projects](https://github.com/nikodemus/foolang/projects) to see
what's currently scoped. If something there appeals to you, PRs are super
welcome&mdash;_but_ unless the item is super simple and obvious you're probably
better off first being in touch to make sure we're on the same page.
