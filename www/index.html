  <h1>Foolang</h1>
  <p style="margin: 0 2em;"><em>The Foo Programming Language</em>
  <p>Foolang is a Smalltalk-inspired object language that tries to take some
  lessons from concatenative languages to heart.

  <h2>Opinions</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Messages instead of method invocations is the right metaphor.</li>
    <li>Code is best read and written left-to-right.</li>
    <li>The less variables one needs to express oneself clearly, the better.</li>
    <li>Smalltalk-style environment is still better than anything other
    languages have to offer.</li>
    <li>Image based development is not a good idea: focusing on reproduction of
    state is better than saving state.</li>
    <li>Stateful notebooks are a good idea, but as an exploration tool, not as
    a development environment.</li>
    <li>A well designed language plus a semi-decent compiler should reliably
    produce code roughly matching the performance of equivalent -O1 compiled
    C++ code. Factor of 2 is acceptable, factor of 10 is not.</li>
    <li>A language that doesn't have a good solution for doing multithreading
    reliably is not a modern general purpose language.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Stay tuned!
